# liri-node-app

In this assignment, I made a iPhone-like SIRI application. LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Connected to different API's, LIRI took in commands that used APIs and requests from Twitter, Spotify, and IMDB.
